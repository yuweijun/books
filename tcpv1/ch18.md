[![The normal TLS connection initiation exchange consists of several messages that may be pipelined. Required messages have solid arrows and are shown in boldface type. An abbreviated exchange takes place if a previously existing connection can be restarted. This avoids endpoint authentication, which can be costly for systems with limited processing capabilities.](figure_18-30.png)](figure_18-30.png "The normal TLS connection initiation exchange consists of several messages that may be pipelined.
