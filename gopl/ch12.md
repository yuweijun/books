### **Chapter 12. Reflection**

Go provides a mechanism to do the following on variables without knowing their types at compile time:

* Update variables and inspect their values at run time
* Call their methods
* Apply the operations intrinsic to their representation

This mechanism is called [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)). Reflection also lets us treat types themselves as first-class values.

This chapter covers Go's reflection features on how they increase the expressiveness of the language, and in particular how they are crucial to the implementation of two
important APIs:

* String formatting provided by [`fmt`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/)
* Protocol encoding provided by packages like [`encoding/json`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) and [`encoding/xml`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/).

Reflection is also essential to the template mechanism provided by the [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) and [html/template](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) packages as seen in [Section 4.6](ch4.md#text-and-html-templates). However, reflection is complex to reason about and not for casual use, so although these packages are implemented using reflection, they do not expose reflection in their own APIs.

### Why Reflection?

Sometimes we need to write a function capable of dealing uniformly with values of types, which have one of the following traits:

* They don't satisfy a common interface,
* They don't have a known representation,
* They don't exist at the time we design the function,
* All three of above.

A familiar example is the formatting logic within `fmt.Fprintf`, which can usefully print an arbitrary value of any type, even a user-defined one.
